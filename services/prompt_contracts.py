  period. The sentence belongs inside the same positive prompt.
- Hard tags own discrete facts. The sentence owns relationships, contact points,
  held objects, garment state, foreground/background interaction and main-light
  direction. Repeat only a few high-value anchors and add no new fact.
- Use natural spaces and comma separators for ordinary tags. Preserve exact
  tool-returned filenames and trigger words. Escape ordinary parentheses in
  rendered Danbooru tags as `\\(` and `\\)`.

  identity, work title, LoRA tags or guessed default appearance in negative.

  in the `name|work` lookup hint or final identity tag; do not silently discard
  the alias before the plugin can exact-confirm it.
- User-explicit appearance and outfit changes remain in the positive prompt.
  The plugin will independently exact-check Character/Copyright evidence,
  remove conflicting identities and unsupported appearance guesses, and add
  only trusted current LoRA or safe Gallery atomic evidence.
- A missing character LoRA is not permission to guess a file and is not a reason
  to keep an old identity. Never copy a whole trainedWords list into the prompt.

Runtime LoRA capability:
- Query a named saved style with `list_anima_lora_presets`; query an explicitly

- A style preset is one complete ordered base stack. Copy all returned controls
  unchanged and do not replace, truncate or supplement it with guessed peers.
- Character LoRA is optional and separate from the style stack. Use at most the
  uniquely matched current asset; if no unique result exists, continue with
  verified semantic identity rather than guessing a file.
- A character LoRA must bind to the same exact-confirmed Character canonical.
  Armed, Bunny, Dress or other variant identities never substitute for the base
  identity unless that exact variant was explicitly requested and confirmed.
- Do not claim a lookup or save succeeded unless the corresponding tool returned
  success. Tool metadata aids retrieval but never overrides user-visible facts.

DANBOORU_CAPABILITY_CONTRACT = """
Runtime Danbooru capability:
- Use `search_anima_danbooru_tags` only when it is actually available and only
  for bounded uncertainty. Character, Copyright, Artist and General are separate
  evidence domains.
- Character exact or unique alias may identify a character. Copyright only
  qualifies a work; Artist never identifies a character; General describes
  appearance, clothing, action, composition or scene.
- Prefix, keyword, fuzzy, embedding and rerank results are candidates only.
  Exact-confirm the selected canonical in its proper category before using it.
- For a localized character name, query the name together with its explicit work,
  for example `《鸣潮》的菲比`. The localized layer may return several same-name
  candidates and must never choose by popularity. Continue only when the tool
  returns one verified Character canonical with an exact Copyright qualifier.
- Once a Character query returns verified exact, use that returned canonical in
  both positive tags and the character lookup hint. Do not query the same
  identity again by a localized name or replace the exact canonical with prose.

PROMPT_PLAN_CAPABILITY_CONTRACT = """
Runtime Prompt Plan capability:
- Resolve the requested plan with `list_anima_prompt_plans`; never invent an ID.

- A stored plan does not bypass current LoRA freshness or character evidence
